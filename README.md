# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition Assignment Solutions by Doron Serebro

I'm just another geek trying to learn computer vision from Stanford's CNN course :)

The solutions are to the 2020 version of assignments (most notable differences are in [assignment 3](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2020/assignment3/) )

## Assignment 1
1. [KNN Classifier](../blob/master/Assignment1/knn.ipynb)
2. [SVM Classifier](../blob/master/Assignment1/svm.ipynb)
3. [SoftMax Classifier](../blob/master/Assignment1/softmax.ipynb)
4. [2-Layer Neural Network](../blob/master/Assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)
5. [Image Features](../blob/master/Assignment1/features.ipynb)

## Assignment 2
1. Fully-connected Neural Network
2. Batch Normalization
3. Dropout
4. Convolutional Networks
5. TensorFlow on CIFAR-10

## Assignment 3
1. Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs
2. SVM Classifier
3. Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images
4. Style Transfer
5. Generative Adversarial Networks

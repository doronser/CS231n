# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition Assignment Solutions by Doron Serebro

I'm just another geek trying to learn computer vision from Stanford's CNN course :)

The solutions are to the 2020 version of assignments (most notable differences are in [assignment 3](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2020/assignment3/) )

## Assignment 1
1. [KNN Classifier](Assignment1/knn.ipynb)
2. [SVM Classifier](Assignment1/svm.ipynb)
3. [SoftMax Classifier](/Assignment1/softmax.ipynb)
4. [2-Layer Neural Network](Assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)
5. [Image Features](Assignment1/features.ipynb)

## Assignment 2
1. [Fully-connected Neural Network](assignment2/FullyConnectedNets.ipynb)
2. [Batch Normalization](assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb)
3. [Dropout](assignment2/Dropout.ipynb)
4. [Convolutional Networks](assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb)
5. [TensorFlow on CIFAR-10](assignment2/TensorFlow.ipynb)

## Assignment 3
1. [Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs](assignment3/RNN_Captioning.ipynb)
2. [Image Captioning with LSTMs](assignment3/LSTM_Captioning.ipynb)
3. [Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images](assignment3/NetworkVisualization-TensorFlow.ipynb)
4. [Style Transfer](assignment3/StyleTransfer-TensorFlow.ipynb)
5. [Generative Adversarial Networks](assignment3/Generative_Adversarial_Networks_TF.ipynb)
